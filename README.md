# List-of-Green-AI-tools-and-Resources ü§ñüå±

*Check out this carefully selected compilation of excellent resources and tools for Green AI, aimed at minimizing the environmental footprint associated with the utilization and implementation of artificial intelligence.*




In 2020, the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector accounted for an estimated 2.1-3.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions. As the ICT sector continues to expand, its carbon footprint is projected to double to 6-8% by 2025. To align with the Paris Agreement, the industry must reduce its emissions by 45% from 2020 to 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 (Freitag et al., 2021).

With AI being one of the fastest-growing sectors, it holds significant potential to mitigate carbon footprint across various industries (AI Market Size Report, 2022). However, the impact of ICT and AI extends beyond greenhouse gas emissions and electricity usage. It encompasses factors like abiotic resource depletion, primary energy consumption, and water usage, which should be assessed through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) (Arushanyan et al., 2013).

The concept of AI sobriety goes beyond optimizing energy consumption; it involves considering indirect impacts and rebound effects that could offset environmental gains (Willenbacher et al., 2021). Therefore, careful consideration of AI usage is crucial to prevent unintended environmental consequences.
